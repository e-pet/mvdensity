A simple method for estimating multivariate probability densities based on sample data. The method works efficiently in multiple dimensions, with many datapoints (tested up to a million), and is also cheap to *evaluate* on many datapoints. It works simply by computing a multivariate histogram and then smoothing or interpolating the histogram counts.

The code has been developed while I was at the [University of LÃ¼beck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/en/university/university.html), with the [Institute for Electrical Engineering in Medicine](https://www.ime.uni-luebeck.de/institute.html).
